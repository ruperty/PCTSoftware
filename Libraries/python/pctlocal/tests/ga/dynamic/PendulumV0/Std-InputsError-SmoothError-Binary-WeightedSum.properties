# Initial limit of levels
# Initial limit of columns
# Lower limit of levels
# Lower limit of columns
# Limit of error on which to terminate individual evaluation
# Probability for crossover
# Probability for mutating an individual
# Number of times the evaulation is run (with different random seeds)
# Type of errors collected
# Error function
